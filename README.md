# <img src="src/js-simple.png"  width="25"> Js Engine
A Game Engine developed in JavaScript used for quick prototyping and easy development. Documentation still isn't done, but I'm working on it, so chill.
The engine is made up of a series of systems that tie into a larger class. Game Objects are called Entites and can be extended with child classes.
Uses pixijs for rendering and that JS library for statuses.
